## 1. Introduction: The Digital World Around Us

### Your Daily Life and Processors
Every action with technology involves processors making billions of decisions per second. For example, taking a selfie involves touch controllers, CPUs, ISPs, GPUs, and more.

### Why Understanding Processors Matters
Processors are present in cars, homes, workplaces, and public spaces, managing everything from safety systems to automation and computing.

| Location      | Processors Present         | What They Do                  |
|--------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Car          | Engine control, safety    | Fuel injection, airbags, GPS  |
| Home         | Thermostat, router, etc.  | Temperature, automation       |
| Workplace    | Computers, printers       | Computing, access control     |
| Public Space | Traffic lights, payments  | Management, transactions      |

### The Technology Hierarchy
Technology is a skyscraper; RISC-V defines the processor architecture and assembly language layers:

```asm
graph TD
	A[Applications] --> B[Programming Languages]
	B --> C[Operating Systems]
	C --> D[Software Libraries]
	D --> E[Compilers/Interpreters]
	E --> F[Assembly Language (RISC-V)]
	F --> G[Processor Architecture (RISC-V)]
	G --> H[Digital Logic Design]
	H --> I[Transistors & Circuits]
	I --> J[Silicon Manufacturing]
```

## 2. What Are Processors?

### The Processor as the "Brain" Metaphor
Processors are fast calculators, not true brains. They perform:

#### Basic Capabilities
1. Arithmetic: Add, subtract, multiply, divide
2. Logic: AND, OR, NOT
3. Comparison: Greater, less, equal
4. Memory Access: Read/write data
5. Decision Making: Conditional execution
6. Input/Output: Communicate with peripherals

#### What Processors Cannot Do Directly
- Understand human language
- See or hear
- Learn or adapt
- Create content

### The Instruction Execution Cycle
Every processor follows this cycle billions of times per second:
1. FETCH: Get instruction from memory
2. DECODE: Interpret instruction
3. EXECUTE: Perform operation
4. WRITEBACK: Store result
5. REPEAT: Next instruction

**Example: Add Two Numbers**
```assembly
add x3, x1, x2   # x3 = x1 + x2
```

### Processor Performance Metrics Explained

#### Clock Speed (Frequency)
Measured in Hertz (Hz), indicates instruction cycles per second.

| Frequency | Cycles/sec | Typical Usage           |
|-----------|------------|------------------------|
| 1 MHz     | 1 million  | Early microcontrollers |
| 100 MHz   | 100 million| Embedded systems       |
| 1 GHz     | 1 billion  | Smartphones, tablets   |
| 3 GHz     | 3 billion  | Desktop computers      |

#### Instructions Per Cycle (IPC)
- Simple: 1 instruction/cycle
- Superscalar: 2-4 instructions/cycle
- High-performance: 4-8 instructions/cycle

#### Performance Calculation
Performance = Clock Speed × IPC × Efficiency

## 3. Understanding Binary and Data Representation

### Why Binary? The Physical Reality
Binary is reliable, fast, and power-efficient for electronic circuits.

#### Electronic Implementation
High voltage = 1 (ON), Low voltage = 0 (OFF)

### Number Systems Comparison

| Decimal | Binary   | Octal | Hex | Powers of 2 Breakdown      |
|---------|----------|-------|-----|----------------------------|
| 0       | 0000     | 0     | 0   | 0×2³ + 0×2² + 0×2¹ + 0×2⁰ |
| 1       | 0001     | 1     | 1   | 0×2³ + 0×2² + 0×2¹ + 1×2⁰ |
| 15      | 1111     | 17    | F   | 1×2³ + 1×2² + 1×2¹ + 1×2⁰ |

### Data Types in Detail

#### Bit-Level Operations
```assembly
# Bitwise AND
# A = 10110101 (181), B = 11010011 (211)
# Result: 10010001 (145)
# Bitwise OR
# Result: 11110111 (247)
# Bitwise XOR
# Result: 01100110 (102)
```

#### Signed vs Unsigned Numbers
- Unsigned 8-bit: 0 to 255
- Signed 8-bit: -128 to +127

#### Two’s Complement Explained
```assembly
# Represent -5 in 8-bit two’s complement:
# Step 1: 00000101 (5)
# Step 2: 11111010 (invert bits)
# Step 3: 11111011 (add 1)
# Verification: 11111011 + 00000101 = 00000000 (discard overflow)
```

## 4. Registers: The Processor’s Workspace

### Physical Implementation of Registers
Registers are built from flip-flops, providing fast, small storage.

### Register Construction
Each 32-bit register = 32 flip-flops (bits)

### RISC-V Register Set (Complete Analysis)
RISC-V has 32 general-purpose registers (x0-x31) plus special registers.

| Register | ABI Name | Category      | Usage/Rules                       |
|----------|----------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| x0       | zero     | Special      | Always zero, writes ignored       |
| x1       | ra       | Function call| Return address                    |
| x2       | sp       | Stack mgmt   | Stack pointer, 16-byte aligned    |
| x3       | gp       | Global data  | Global pointer                    |
| x4       | tp       | Thread data  | Thread pointer                    |
| x5-x7    | t0-t2    | Temporaries  | Caller-saved                      |
| x8       | s0/fp    | Saved/Frame  | Saved register or frame pointer   |
| x9       | s1       | Saved        | Callee-saved                      |
| x10-x11  | a0-a1    | Args/Return  | First two args & return values    |
| x12-x17  | a2-a7    | Arguments    | Args 3-8, caller-saved            |
| x18-x27  | s2-s11   | Saved        | Callee-saved                      |
| x28-x31  | t3-t6    | Temporaries  | More caller-saved                 |

#### The Special x0 Register
```assembly
add x5, x3, x0   # Copy x3 to x5
add x5, x0, x0   # Clear x5 to zero
addi x5, x0, 42  # Load immediate value
add x0, x1, x2   # Discard result
add x0, x0, x0   # NOP (No Operation)
```

#### Function Call Registers (ABI Standard)
See table above for register usage.

#### Calling Convention in Action
```assembly
complex_calculation:
	addi sp, sp, -16
	sw ra, 12(sp)
	sw s0, 8(sp)
	sw s1, 4(sp)
	sw s2, 0(sp)
	mul s0, a0, a1
	mul s1, a2, a3
	slli s2, a4, 1
	add s0, s0, s1
	add a0, s0, s2
	lw s2, 0(sp)
	lw s1, 4(sp)
	lw s0, 8(sp)
	lw ra, 12(sp)
	addi sp, sp, 16
	ret
```

#### Register Allocation Strategies
Manual register management is required in assembly.
```assembly
# Calculate polynomial 3x^2 + 2x + 1 where x is in a0
polynomial:
	mul t0, a0, a0   # x^2
	li t1, 3
	mul t0, t0, t1   # 3x^2
	li t1, 2
	mul t1, a0, t1   # 2x
	add t0, t0, t1   # 3x^2 + 2x
	addi a0, t0, 1   # 3x^2 + 2x + 1
	ret
```

## 5. Memory System Architecture

### Understanding Computer Memory
Memory is organized in a hierarchy based on speed, size, and cost.

| Level      | Size      | Speed   | Cost/Bit | Purpose                |
|------------|-----------|---------|----------|------------------------|
| Registers  | 32×32-bit | 0.1 ns  | High     | Active data            |
| L1 Cache   | 32-64 KB  | 1-2 ns  | High     | Recently used data     |
| L2 Cache   | 256KB-1MB | 5-10 ns | Medium   | Less recent data       |
| L3 Cache   | 8-32 MB   | 20-50 ns| Medium   | Shared cache           |
| Main Mem   | 4-32 GB   | 50-100ns| Low      | Program storage        |
| SSD        | 256GB-4TB | 0.1-1ms | Very Low | Long-term storage      |
| HDD        | 1-10 TB   | 5-10ms  | Very Low | Bulk storage           |

#### Why This Hierarchy Exists
Fast memory is expensive and small; slow memory is cheap and large. Programs use small portions actively.

### Virtual Memory System
Virtual memory gives each program a large, private address space.

#### Address Translation
```assembly
# lw x1, 0x10000000  # Virtual address
# MMU translates to physical address
```

### Memory Access Patterns and Performance
#### Cache-Friendly vs Cache-Unfriendly Code
```assembly
# Cache-friendly: sequential access
loop_good:
	li t0, 0
	li t1, 0
	li t2, 1000
loop:
	beq t1, t2, done
	slli t3, t1, 2
	add t4, a0, t3
	lw t5, 0(t4)
	add t0, t0, t5
	addi t1, t1, 1
	j loop
done:
	mv a0, t0
# Cache-unfriendly: random access
loop_bad:
	li t0, 0
	li t1, 0
	li t2, 1000
	li t6, 64
loop:
	beq t1, t2, done
	mul t3, t1, t6
	slli t3, t3, 2
	add t4, a0, t3
	lw t5, 0(t4)
	add t0, t0, t5
	addi t1, t1, 1
	j loop
done:
	mv a0, t0
```

## 6. Processor Execution Models

### In-Order Execution: The Simple Approach
Executes instructions in sequence. Simple, predictable, but limited parallelism.

### Out-of-Order Execution: The Performance Approach
Executes independent instructions in parallel for higher performance.

### Specialized Execution Models
- Dataflow Processors: Execute instructions as data becomes available.
- Vector Processors: Operate on arrays of data in parallel.

---

## 7. RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture

### Instruction Formats (Binary Encoding)
#### Why Fixed Instruction Width?
Simplifies hardware and decoding.

#### R-Type Format (Register-Register Operations)
```assembly
add x3, x1, x2   # x3 = x1 + x2
```

#### I-Type Format (Immediate Operations)
```assembly
addi x5, x0, 42  # x5 = 42
```

### Load/Store Architecture Deep Dive
#### Why Load/Store Architecture?
Separates memory access from computation.

#### Memory Access Instructions
```assembly
lw x5, 0(x6)     # Load word from memory
sw x5, 0(x6)     # Store word to memory
```

#### Address Calculation Modes
```assembly
# Address = base + offset
add t4, a0, t3
lw t5, 0(t4)
```

---

## 8. Control Flow and Program Structure

### Conditional Branches
#### Branch Instruction Format (B-Type)
```assembly
beq x1, x2, label   # if x1 == x2, jump to label
bne x1, x2, label   # if x1 != x2, jump to label
```

#### Branch Conditions and Implementation
Use comparison instructions and branch based on result.

#### Control Flow Examples
```assembly
main:
	li a0, 10
	li a1, 20
	jal ra, complex_calculation
	# Result in a0
```

### Loop Implementation Patterns
#### For Loop Variants
```assembly
for_loop:
	li t0, 0
	li t1, 10
loop:
	beq t0, t1, end
	# loop body
	addi t0, t0, 1
	j loop
end:
```

#### Nested Loops and Performance
Use inner and outer loop counters for multidimensional data.

## 9. Advanced RISC-V Features and Extensions

### The Extension System Philosophy
RISC-V supports modular extensions for added functionality.

#### Standard Extensions
- M: Multiplication/Division
- A: Atomic Operations

### M Extension: Multiplication and Division
#### Why a Separate Extension?
Keeps base ISA simple and extensible.

#### M Extension Instructions
```assembly
mul x5, x6, x7   # Multiply
div x5, x6, x7   # Divide
```

### A Extension: Atomic Operations
#### Why Atomic Operations?
Enable safe concurrency and synchronization.

#### Load-Reserved/Store-Conditional
```assembly
lr.w t0, (a0)      # Load-reserved
sc.w t1, t2, (a0)  # Store-conditional
```
